# React Redux TypeScript

This project is based on the apps from the official [Redux Essentials](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts). This trail focuses on vanilla Javascript. The goal on this project is to demonstrate a TypeScript implementation of this, as well as provide unit testing where non exists.

It contains the classic counter along with a small social media feed app. The code for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/timofeysie/redux-typescript). There are branches named after some of the steps to provide a jumping off point if needed.
